### Developmental Principles

Here are some developmental principles I believe in.

- Pay for use Api-Keys prevent access to technology and thus technological innovation.
- Discord is closed source and has a terrible reputation, use element instead.
- Linux Elitism is in poor taste. UNIX, BSD and other open source operating systems exist.
- Avoid "Not my problem" -ism.
