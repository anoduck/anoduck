_This will be a continual work in progress_

### Daily Drivers

### Developmental Principles  

Here are some developmental principles I believe in.  

- Pay for use Api-Keys prevent access to technology and thus technological innovation.  
- Discord is closed source and has a terrible reputation, use element instead.  
- Linux Elitism is in poor taste. UNIX, BSD, and other open source operating systems exist.  
- Avoid "Not my problem" -ism.
